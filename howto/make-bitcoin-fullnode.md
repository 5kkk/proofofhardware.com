# Make a Bitcoin Full Node 
### The definitive Guide

While many people are concerned with mining Bitcoin, few are running Bitcoin fullnodes. A Bitcoin fullnode is an instance of `bitcoind` running with the
entire bitcoin blockchain. For the health and speed of the network, it is
ideal for Bitcoin Fullnodes to be geographically dispersed. If you are running
a mining farm, it is also good to have a local Bitcoin Fullnode to decrease
latency of transactions.

The final reason it is great to run a bitcoin fullnode is because you
BELIEVE IN BITCOIN, BLOCKCHAIN and CRYPTOCURRENCY. It is the RIGHT thing to do.

The Bitcoin Fullnode is the BIBLE of BITCOIN that is continuously written :)

This guide is meant to be best CURRENT practice in a few scenarios
